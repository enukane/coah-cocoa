** Name **
Coah-cocoa or Cocoah
** WTF is this **
Porting of Coah(http://9.dotpp.net/), the Toho Sosowa(http://www5d.biglobe.ne.jp/~coolier2/SS_kai.html) browser.
As original Coah is written in C# and seems like only works on Windows(maybe..), 
this project is motivated to let it or same things work on MacOSX.

** これはなに **
Coah(http://9.dotpp.net/), 東方創想話のブラウザのようなものを目指したソフトウェアです.
オリジナルのCoahはC#で書かれており(たぶん)Windowsでしか動かないので, Mac版でも
同じようなソフトが欲しい！ということで創っています.


** usage **
These are executable script: 
	coah_get_current_list.rb
		show pages list
	coah_get_ss.rb <page_number>
		show ss list in the specified page identified with page_number
	coah_get_sslist.rb <page_number> <ss_id>
		show ss text identified by <ss_id>, which is linked from page with <page_number>

** vim plugin **
type ":source coah.vim" on this directory, then you can use commands as below
	:CoahLoadList
		Download and parse index page to list of ss pages, and number to identify them
	:CoahLoadPage <page_number>
		parse page specified with <page_number> and show list of ss belongs to it, and id for them
	:CoahLoadSS <page_number> <ss_id>
		show ss text on buffer, which was specified by <page_number> and <ss_id>

These commands uses scripts above to find list, pages, ss.
